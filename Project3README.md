The Glossary to be a Good Human

![demo]()

"The Glossary to be a Good Human" is a minimalist etymological work 
dedicated to the understanding that language is a powerful medium that
is constantly growing, changing, and evolving with the sociopolitical climate.
It asks users to understand that words may no longer be interpreted by their 
original definitions and therefore gives users the opportunity to recognize words
that should be added to their arsenal of vocabulary, to understand the evolution 
and power in words that have been reclaimed, and redact words that no longer serve
language through an inclusive, anti-racist, or diverse lens and instead bring pain, 
harm, and suffering to various communities. I intend for this piece to serve as an 
educational space for allyship and learning through the power of language.
