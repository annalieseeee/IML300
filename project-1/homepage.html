    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
 1.28.21
 There was a quote I heard years ago, I barely recall its proper phrasing but the gist of it has remained with me for years—the most notable and nostalgic aspects of each technological innovation were once considered its greatest flaws. Molly Soda’s website along with Odell’s “How to Internet” and Schwulst’s “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?” are unique in their comedy, information, and design expression, but at their core it is their nostalgic references to the birth of the web and the utilization as we know it that unify their intentions. Schwulst vividly illustrates websites as various natural or manmade elements in order to elucidate that websites are what each user makes of it, they exist for different purposes some may be ephemeral and others long lasting but they regardless of their purpose, they are “inherently unfinished.” Her perspective emphasizes that websites are powerful modes of individual expression and in a world dominated by capitalism and profit, strength in reclaiming the web is possible through a conglomeration of individual efforts. She writes, “Individuals can steer the web back to its original architecture simply by having a website.” This statement resonated with me as I have often felt that making a website for my work is “succumbing to the trend” but rather it is reclaiming my strength as a user as clearly noted in Molly Soda’s website and other works. She not only pushes the boundaries of professionalism and acceptability through her format and content but cultivates a unique space just as Schwulst hopes of many users. Soda’s work is not only comedic but offers a visual commentary on her sense of self in the world around her. She pays no regard to the “netiquette” that Odell references and that is why it is all the more captivating. Odell too fears the acquisition of internet originality by hyper production value or big business and she is correct. Videos continually feel so manufactured, in fact the occupation title “Influencer” would not exist without the internet. All essentially agree through their varying litanies or visual imageries that the internet of today has lost some of his ingenuity; it is essential a Penrose staircase continually looping and forcing users into repetitive habits. These readings and viewings were helpful because they expressed a sentiment of user monotony that I had not given words to but felt entirely all too much.

    The internet feels like such an elusive space constantly changing and with its power dynamics always shifting. It reminds me of the fight for net neutrality not too long ago. I was immediately shocked at the statistics that 30-50% of women worked as programmers but it was not until men were interested in the occupation that the pay began to rise. It was not until this lecture that I have heard this detail. It is infuriating how patriarchal and sexist values have not only reshaped the industry but the historical information that people receive. Young girls would be so inspired to learn the role that women played in the formation of the web and its counterparts. The “How the Internet works” video helped provide visual clarity and technical understanding to something that feels so easy yet so complex like sending an email. I am hopeful that the future of the internet will hold a more intersectional perspective and belong to the people rather than big business. It is such a fast developing resource that has infiltrated many aspects of life.

Olia Lialina’s article “Rich User Experience, UX and Desktopization of War” brings up several intriguing points about the intersection of user’s experience and interface design. While the article is a bit antiquated in its references from the distant memory that is now vine to “what did peeman pee on” gif that I had actually never heard before reading this article. Lialina points out the commodification of the online experience and the dangers it poses, she begins by airing her grievances on the creation of the “UNDO” button and the inability to replicate it the real world. It represents, as she calls it, a “desktopization” of war, the result it an unsettling similarity to a game rather than an understanding of the gravity that is occurring. This comes from a lack of historical and theoretical study in interface design. Lialina’s article expertly traverses what feels like the mundane to the more grievous possibilities of interface design and the convergence of all the real with the seemingly real.  

Frank Chimero’s blogpost “What Screens Want” explores the progression of screen design by presenting various metaphors for modifications of items beyond that of software such as aspirin and Muybridge’s famous photography sequence of a horse running. Screens and software and are continually developing and now incorporate many skeumorphs with the idea that people are not searching for exactly what they want but rather a software imitation that allows us to do infinitely more that the tangible item. 

Black Gooey Universe explores the incubation of whiteness that has dominated the tech industry since its infancy in the Bay area to its present state of power and domination. The 70s marked the incorporation of antiblackness in the tech world with the shift of the computer interface from a black screen to a white one that crafted the persisting illusion of white neutrality in tech and forced the ideology upon users that blackness is therefore the antithesis to transparency. American Artist further describes that it is through the skeumorphic interface that the illusion of transparency that have helped white supremacy and cis-gender white males continue to dominate the tech world.

    Heather Dewey-Hagborg’s TedxVienna Talk titled “I steal DNA from strangers” discusses the evidence accidentally left behind by human bodies, the information it holds and the vulnerabilities it shares about us. She developed an infatuation with the possibility of extracting information, enrolled in a course, and collected samples ranging from chewing gum to cigarette butts but failed in her attempted extractions each and every time. She explores the personal and physical characteristics embedded in DNA and uses the blueprint of DNA in her creation of 3D portraits. The exhibition was them covered by various news outlets and sparked a debate on biological surveillance. She hoped it would serve as a thought-provoking spectacle that called attention to a rarely discussed breach of privacy. She believes we must develop methods to protect our biological privacy just as we protect our digital foot-print and shares her recipe for a DNA invisible spray she created. 

Lauren McCarthy in her talk at Eyeo 2019 shares her thought provoking artistic work and also discusses other works that explore the intersection of surveillance, social networking, and the effects it has on humans’ social interactions with others and themselves. She notes her favorite moments from her 2016 work “Follower” in which users could request to be followed by McCarthy. She retells her other artistic explorations between the intersection of AI and humanity, its possibilities, its shortcomings, and she even poses as a form of AI called “Lauren,” her own name and a play on Alexa to add a human touch to technology intended to assist and anticipate its users’ needs. Each project brought her new knowledge and understanding of the human condition as it exists with technology, AI, and surveillance and the comforting feeling that comes with the idea of “home.” McCarthy expands on eventually breaking into the world of open source software and its lack of welcome because she felt as if she did not fit the mold. It is through this sentiment that she designs p5.js, a web processing tool kit, that carries the intention to enable those that are typically excluded from the processing space. Creators wanted to take work with the feelings of uncertainty that comes from being “othered” and generate a welcoming, learning space that brings the feeling of home. It was so exciting to hear Professor Q mentioned for helping craft and make this technology available with the incorporation care and accessibility. This speech was not only inspiring and informative but I appreciated how adamant McCarthy was in her hope to bring awareness to the need for inclusivity in the programming space. 

Sydette Harry examines the role cultural norms and biases have on surveillance and its technological progression. She explores the hyper-visibility that surveillance has placed on black women and provides an example in the rise of the big booty era cited by Patricia Garcia and credited to Jennifer Lopez and Iggy Azaelea, a grievous instance of the erasure of black women, their bodies, and the enduring objectification they have experienced. Harry’s mention of the big booty era reminds me of the atrocious treatment of Sarah Baartman, a woman paraded around and forced to show her buttock in the 1700s because it was considered quite large. black women have long been ogled and scrutinized by the media for their bodies. Feminism that ignores intersectionality, dubbed as white feminism, is entirely empty if it does not incorporate the needs of black women. They are often forced to exist in a space that surveilles them heavily and requires them to expose their traumas in order to be accepted or given any sympathies. Harry’s article presents the idea that surveillance technology needs to incorporate the biases that society has portrayed as normalcy. 

    3.4.21
    Rosa Menkman’s Glitch Studies Manifesto explores upgrade culture and the proprietary myth that technology is seeking to be closer to perfection with every upgrade. She notes that every item that is created with have notes of imperfection; it is inescapable. Menkman wants to escape the negative definition associated with the glitch and instead explores the manifestation of the glitch and the multiple ways it should be seen as a gift rather than a burden. She views it as an opportunity to step out of the typical and expected binaries of functionality, and instead generates a new path that breaks the mold of expectations. There is a term for this, it is called “glitch art.” Humanity, with an emphasis on the theorists and historians seeks to label glitch art as one or the other when it in inherently liminal and continually evolving and responsible for evolutions. Thus, the glitch and its counterparts exist well in the transmedia space that traverse multiple medias and platforms to add emphasis to particular meanings. She ends her discussion with a statement of encouragement asking readers to let glitch studies into their spaces to challenge and expand their knowledge. 

Hito Steyerl’s “In Defense of the Poor Image” explores the reproduction of images and their loss of high quality resolution through this replication. The poor image is continually berated because it does not fit within the elitist and consumerist ideals of the original image. The poor image and its creation are actually a feat in and of itself. For example, the poor image is created and appropriated as a response to the privatization and restructuring of media. She crafts an argument defending the poor image, conception, and its divisive role in the privatized media space. Steyerl is a proponent of the poor image because not only does it counter the commodification of the industry but allows for the participation of a much larger group of people therefore merging “life and art.” The poor image provides an opportunity for remix and with that cultivates a new space in the media world. 

An Xiao Mina discusses her book “Memes to Movement” and crafts an argument that begins with cats and their historical association with persecution, femininity, and witchcraft. In contrast to dogs, they have had a much more private role in popular culture. She explains the link between cute cats of the internet and activism, i.e. activist messages were embedded within the cute cat image in order to evade China’s censorship. She explores memes, their use intersection in sociopolitical and comedic spaces. Mina delves into several definitions of memes and applies them to several memes. She points out in her studies the surviving characteristics of meme dynamics, the remix of memes, and how some information finds itself in memetic form. She references several political movements, and movements born out of co-opting movements as well as deconstructs how co-opting meme content is a form of remix. For example, the All Lives Matter movement not only co-opted the phrase of BLM but it was created as a response to censor the Black Lives Matter Movement. She expands upon the power of memes not solely for comedic purposes but instead are reshaping the internet and have even been utilized by corporations and governments to further or quell particular social justice movements. 


   3.11.21
    Joy Buolamwini’s Ted Talk titled “How I'm fighting bias in algorithms” discusses her experiences using technology that could not recognize her face due to their “coded gaze.” She further defines the coded gaze and the fact that bias can be coded into various technologies and this occurs when software training sets do not include diverse faces. She expands on the dangers of algorithmic biases particularly when they are used in the legal system to identify and charge people. She ends by encouraging people to not only recognize that this bias occurs but help galvanize change by joining “The Algorithmic Justice League” to fight the coded gaze. The league also has a variety of other features that help promote social change and inclusivity by allowing users to request audits and report biases.

Stephanie Dinkins’ “Afro-now-ism” very poignantly explores the vital need for the realization the blatant hypocrisy between longstanding American ideals with the current status of power and systemic inequalities. She emphasizes a need for a restructuring of what is deemed valuable versus invaluable not only within humanity but with nature as well. The need for a reimagining of the past, present, and future, can help POC reframe the biases that have been impressed upon them but cultivate a greater world. It is also required to understand the ways in which opaque algorithms that are already in existence can egregiously continue or deepen systemic inequalities. A new world with the incorporation of more AI technology is in fruition but for the most equitable world to be created that understands intersectionality and inclusion, there must be a liberation and redefinition of thought. 

Mimi Onuoha’s Eyeo speech titled “How We Became Machine Readable” discusses the creation of data sets, her experiences with disrespectful catcalling while walking in New York City, and her incorporation of this experience and inadvertently gathering a data set of men who texted her after catcalling. On this subject, she further expands on the historical and biased creation of the Lynd’s “Middletown” data set as if was viewed to be a reflection of all American societies except their data set was inherently flawed as it viewed African Americans and peripheral and therefore did not incorporate them in their data. She mentions a necessity to “evening the playing field of knowledge” and this can be done through various features like zines which can be full of information and easily distributed. Onuoha ends her talk with a call to action for viewers to recognize that it is a myth that the further gathering of information will generate all the answers and what is not gathered with be figured out regardless. The fact of the matter is that the lens of attention in data gathering has never been fully diversified or inclusive. Data sets of past studies need to be contextualized and information that was once deemed complicating factors needs to be reassessed. 

 3.25.21
Yaa Addae’s piece on Data Healing centers around Olivia Ross, a media artist and programmer who coined the term data trauma. A term depicting the impersonal collection of data that views people as “users” rather than humans that are ever evolving and changing and the therefore triggering or harmful targeted content that can present itself online. Addae then presents various works or ideologies which are portions of an antidote that comprise data healing, a necessary alternative to the present state of the internet. 

Morehshin Allahyari’s 2017 Eyeo talk focuses on the intersection of art and technologies and the importance of crafting art that goes beyond aesthetic. She explores the influences of her childhood in Iran on her art and Iranian’s interaction with objects that are considered taboo and how it shapes their relationship with the aforementioned object. A majority of her work and her Eyeo speech focuses on relationships, specifically ISIS’ relationship to destruction and its use of social media and a site of propaganda. She introduces the term “addivist” which is an extended metaphor intended to encompass additive technology like 3D printing and its role in activism as depicted in her recreation of historic items destroyed by ISIS. She believes that these technologies or the files should be shared freely or it is simply a new form of colonialism. 

Olivia McKayla Ross’ contributers zine is an ode to p5js and the talented contributers that have utilized it to create moving personal projects, artistic pieces, collaborative efforts, social justice works or some combination of all of the above. Ross has crafted a space for people to learn and explore not only the world of code, but their personal thoughts and biases, to ultimately craft a space that always growing, changing, and healing.

    4.1.21
   Ari Melenciano’s talk titled “Omni-Specialized Design for Beautiful Futures” revolves around the re-imagining of design to include interdisciplinary concepts like intersectionality and equity. She discusses the formation of Afrotectopia, a community where race and culture can be discussed in tandem rather than two separate entities. It now has an annual festival and school to celebrate innovation, cultural expression and racial activism. She references how it is vital it is that Black and underprivileged voices exist in the tech space. One of her projects titled “Building a Museum 353 Years Into the Future” follows the concept that it is an environment “so far into the future that is beyond all this racism and oppression” where Black artists can create art that does not always have to include their racial and social identity unless they so choose. She then points out that this is a vision that must be worked back from so the present is working toward creating this possibility. She also redefines various roles in creation and design as well is shares the concept that things should be designed “with not for” with a circular economy so the future is a greater place.
    
  Audre Lorde’s The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House explores the narrow standards imposed on feminism that are still engrained with patriarchal characteristics and inequalities. She speaks of her experience attending a humanities conference that advocates for tolerance between women of their differences rather than the acceptance and utilization of them. It is crucial that the liberation of all people that identify as women requires the inclusion of those beyond those that exist in the academic feminist circle. She crafts an excellent extended metaphor to compare the tragic repetition that persists and keeps women down in cycles of oppression.
    
    Hamid Khan’s interview with the MIT Technology Review examines how police surveillance and its counterparts work to monitor and harm communities of color rather than serve. He discusses several of the program he’s was a part of that helped dismantle programs related to predictive policing that were based on racist algorithms. Khan compares it to another form of capitalism that seeks to view human beings as collections of data. He references moments in history where the LAPD and their budget greatly increased and the ramifications communities of color have seen as a result. It is carrying this knowledge that he shares why he advocates for abolitions of racist programs rather than idealized reform that never truly betters a program.

    Virtual Field Trip
    VIRTUAL FIELD TRIP: After my Capstone class on Friday, I decided I was in need of a virtual adventure so I decided this would be the time to embark on my virtual field trip. I knew it would be a sedentary trip but I didn’t expect it to be so expansive for my mind. I decided to explore the New Art City. I don’t know why but something about Alice Yuan Zhang’s eat me called to me. Upon entering the space, I felt an immediate sense of ease pass over me. I usually associate the digital space with pressure, intensity, and panic but this was an entirely antithetical experience. It begins to feel as if I am calmly floating through the world, I take my hands off the table and rest this in my lap. What I assume is Alice Yuan Zhang’s calming voice is encouraging me to “be go” and “just be,” directions that typically don’t go with exploring and I come to realize this will be a mental exploration to rewire the weariness of humans who rely so intensely on their technology, it is almost a cyborg type of existence. I enjoyed the way Yuan Zhang built this space to resemble a cave and body. She reframes the viewer’s internet consumption, asking them to question themselves and learn about their body’s existence as a technology in and of itself. This intersection of the digital in contrast with the body and mind urges users to reclaim their agency and help others reclaim their agencies as well. Yuan Zhang was visually and verbally descriptive. This piece is beautifully thought out and deeply intentioned. I’m glad it was the space that called to me.
