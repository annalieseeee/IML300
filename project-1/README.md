[The Recipe to Your Humanity](https://github.com/annalieseeee/iml300/blob/master/project-1/asset/breath-in-and-out.gif) is an interactive web experience that explores unconscious movement and identity. 


### Description




The Recipe to your Humanity is an interactive web exploration that attempts to force users to confront their instincts and identity by asking to choose between an inhale and an exhale, a subconscious movement that the human body in incapable of ceasing. It is one of the most natural experiences of humanity and that is why I chose to introduce users to this interaction. Within the project there are spaces of calm and spaces of panic to present the paths that our brains traverse as a result of our thoughts leading to neural connections. It is a consolidated glimpse into a person’s sense of self ending asking users to be honest about their feelings and their identity. The final page asks users to “take what they need” which is intended to help them confront their needs, wants, and requirements for their physical and mental health as a form of self-care.
