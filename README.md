#The Sounds of New York

![demo](rain NYC.gif)

The Sounds of New York is an interactive p5js sketch. It is a space to reimagine the hustle and bustle of the city prior to COVID-19. There are familiar noises of cabs honking, Fank Sinatra's "New York New Tork" playing when pressed as well as Alica Key's "New York State of Mind." While I have never been to the city myself, it has always been a dream of mine so I created me only small piece of what I imagine standing in Times Square feels like as if all these larger than life noises become the music of the city rather than just noises.
